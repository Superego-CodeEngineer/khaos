## Khaos-Server: Open Source Application Server

Khaos is a highly abstracted out-of-the-box application component. This repo is back-end implementation.

In ancient Greek legend, at the beginning of the universe, Khaos(Χάος) was the first to be born alone, an endless, dark and
light carrier. Following Khaos, the god of the earth Gaia(Γαία) was born first, and then Tartarus(Τάρταρος), god of the hell and abyss,
and Eros(Έρως) were born independently, and the world began.

Using microservice architectures, Khaos-Server can be deployed using clusters.
